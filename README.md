## Goal

Starting **June 2025**, I will be solving problems from the [Super-31 CP Sheet](https://www.tle-eliminators.com/cp-sheet), targeting **one rating level per month** to improve:
- Speed
- Accuracy
- Problem-solving skills

This will help in Online Assessments (OAs), Interviews, and competitive contests.
